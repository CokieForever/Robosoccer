## Presentation
The aim was to write a program able to pilot a team of 3 tiny robots in order to make them play soccer in a small field.  
A camera associated with an image processing module provides the position of every robot in real time: no sensor is used in this project.  
4 teams of 5 students each were created. At the end of the semester, a soccer championship takes place to determine the best team.  
The videos of the championship of the SS15 are available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6L5JBu4dpHEfkpOS19LazZpRlBJNkpVMldjZk0wRGlvOHlkNXhRLTEtWXdqeVJ3QUdaSFk).  
The code presented in this repository is the code of the Team C.

## Additional details
All source files are written in C++. The documentation was made with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org).  
The program cannot be executed without at least the simulation system, which cannot be published here because of the copyright. This repository is mainly made to help the future participants of the Laboratory.  
The project was made with QT Creator under Ubuntu 10.4. It requires a stable version of the Simple Directmedia Layer 1.2 library to be installed (available [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php)).  
The revision control tool used for this project was initially Subversion (SVN), and the import to Git was only made at the end for the publication.
